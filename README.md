## Project Overview

This project contains several analysis based on real-world data, including:
1. **Olympic Performance Analysis** - A deep dive into the Olympic Games history.
2. **Relationship between economic and OG Performance** - how economic factors such as GDP influence the performance of countries in the Olympic Games.
3. **FIFA World Cup Analysis** - A study of the relationship between GDP and success in the FIFA World Cup.
4. **Correlation between Population and OG Performance** - Insights into countries' population and athletic achievements.

## Project Details

**Data Sources and Google Cloud Platform Storage**

The datasets used in this project are sourced from Kaggle:
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piterfm/olympic-games-medals-19862018
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piterfm/fifa-football-world-cup
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tunguz/country-regional-and-world-gdp
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/world-population-dataset

Once the datasets were downloaded, they were uploaded to **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**. I created a **bucket** in **Google Cloud Storage** to securely store the raw data, making it easily accessible for further processing.

Using **BigQuery**, I performed **SQL queries** on the data stored in the Cloud Storage bucket. This enabled me to process large datasets, transform them into structured tables, and optimize them for analysis. The processed tables were then made available for use in **Power BI**, where they were used for visualization and reporting.
